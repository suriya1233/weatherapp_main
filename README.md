# DESCRIPTION :
The Weather App with API Integration is a full-stack web application designed to provide real-time weather updates for any location using an external weather API like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI. Users can search for weather details by entering a city name or enable geolocation to fetch automatic updates for their current location. The app displays key weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions, along with optional forecast data for upcoming hours or days. It features unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, a responsive and modern UI with light/dark mode support, and smooth loading states for a seamless user experience. Built using React.js or Vue.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend, the app efficiently handles API requests and optional database storage for user preferences using MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Deployment can be done using Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku for easy accessibility. This project is a great opportunity to practice API integration, frontend-backend communication, and responsive web design in full-stack development.
